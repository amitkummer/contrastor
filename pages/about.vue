          Contrast ratio of background and foreground colors in web development
          is absolute critical to user experience and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of that, I decided making this contrast calculator could be a
          cool idea for making a Vue app and honing my skills with Nuxt.js.

          The site is powered by
          <v-chip link small href="https://vuejs.org/"> Vue </v-chip>
          and built using
          <v-chip link small href="https://nuxtjs.org/"> Nuxt </v-chip> and
          <v-chip link small href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/"> Vuetify </v-chip
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boilerplate for this app was generated using the wonderful
          <v-chip link small href="https://github.com/nuxt/create-nuxt-app">
            create-nuxt-app
          </v-chip>
          project.
